## Description
This zoo animal catalog is built for the zoo owner who wants to keep track of their current animals and zookeepers. For animals, you can filter your search by diet and personality traits. For zookeepers, search by name or age. On the home page, you can add an animal or a zookeeper, so you can make sure the catalog is always up to date.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Express.js
* Node.js

## Usage
On the home page, there are two forms to enter a new animal into the system, or enter a new zookeeper. Fill out the appropriate fields for each and select add.

At the top, select "View Animals" to get a list of all the current animals at the zoo. Each animal card contains the name, species, diet, and personality traits of each animal. In the left hand column, you can filter your search by diet or personality traits. To select more than one personality trait, hold down the command button for macOS or ctrl for Windows when selecting traits.

Select "View Zookeepers" to get a list of all the zookeepers currently employed by the zoo. Each employee card contains the employee's name, age, and favorite animal. In the left hand column, you can search a zookeeper by typing in their name or their age.

To return home, select the "Add To Our Catalog" button that will appear at the top when viewing another page.
